# TODO
######
# Fix register usage (use stacks)
# Garbage collection to destroy subroutines
# Figure out how to make it work with K > 0
#   Since exponentiation only works with non-negative integers, how can we test a logarithm for greater precision? Some form of rooting?
#   Not sure what I meant by the above line, but it's wrong. Negative integers work as bases and powers.
